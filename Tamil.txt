Day 1 (04/27/2023)
	* Explaining basics of Git and Eclipse
	* Created git account
	* Created a maven project
	* pushed local project into online 
	* added collaborator
	
Day 2 (04/28/2023)
	* Importing a project from remote to local (Cloning)
	* General things about Java
		* everything in Java is Object (but there is a but) 
		* Object has structure and it does a specific work
	 
Real time 

Taluk Office

* Marriage certificate, Income certificate, death certificate, Caste certificate

Access Modifer
Personal things 
common things


each room is to do a specfic designated work. 
	each room is called Method.
	Method in java is to do a specific work
	Whatever work you do, it should be a method or inside a method
	Whatever happens inside a method is invisible to others
	You can take reception room water bottle to any methods room but you can not take methods room things to other places (there is a but)

Structure 
People - 50
chair - 100
table - 10

people, chair, table - data type 

People - 100 - chair 100 - data type and variable 
One person in that people name is Sathya - name 

Taluk office building 
	It is to do a set of work - marriage, income & other certificates
	Marriage certificate method, Income certificate method, etc. (each of them are methods)
	Class in java consist of many methods
	Taluk office - Class


People adminstration - package
Chennai Taluk office - Class 
	below are sub classes of Chennai Taluk office 
Velachery Taluk office - Class 
	Velachery east Taluk office - Class (He is sub class of Velachery class)
Tambaram Taluk office - Class
Guindy Taluk office - Class 

* Sub classes of Chennai are Velachery, Guindy and Tambaram
* Velachery east is sub class of Velachery 
* Velachery east is same package of Tambaram but not a sub class of Tambaram

Based on this only we created access modifier 


Police department adminstration - package
Chennai police station 
Tambaram police station 

Hospital administration - package 
chennai hospital (Govt and private) 
tambaram hospital 

Law management - package
Chennai court 
Tambaram court 

Chennai administration - project
	People adminstration - package
	Police department adminstration - package
	Hospital administration - package 
	Law management - package
	

* People adminstration have a set of rules
* Police department have set of rules
* Hopspital adminstration 
	private hospital rules set
	Govt hospital rules set 

These rules set in Java are called interface

Taluk office 
	Receptionist - Chennai Taluk office receptionist
	Reception Phone - Chennai taluk office phone 
	Reception table - Chennai taluk office reception table 
similarly for other classes too. 

They are always belongs to their specific class  - static 
	* Whenever we call a static member outside of class, we call them with their class name 
	* within a class, we call static member directly (no need to call as Chennai Taluk office Receptionist)

Velachery Govt hospital - class 
	* They are scheduling a health checkup camp 
		* In this case, they take doctors, nurses, medicines, operation room, cleaning room and other things from Velachery Govt hospital only

Health checkup camp - Object name 
Object we create for class only
When creating object, they take/create copy of all the things in that class

Tambaram police station wants health check up 
* In Tambaram police station's campus, we create object for Tambaram Govt hospital health check up camp 

Coming back to Taluk office 
clerk in taluk office, we take as constructor

* We just tell what you want 
* you tell what you want with document
* you tell what you want with document1, document2
* you tell what you want with documents, amount
* you tell what you want with amount

Project
	package1
		InterfaceA
		ClassA (Datatype/variables/methods)
			ClassAA 
			ClassAB
		ClassB
		ClassC
	package2
		ClassA
		ClassB
	package3
		ClassX
		ClassA
		

* Class - It does a set of work. It consist of variables and methods. Each work would be done by methods. 

* Methods - It does speicific job. It always written inside a class

* Variable - it can have type(Data type) and posses a number or name;
			variables can have different access - access Modifier
			
* Access Modifier - difines where we can use a variable/method/class

* Interface - It contains rules most of the time. Sometimes it does some work too(means method).
			Interface is always followed by class/classes. 
			When class follows interface, class should do the rule written in the interface

* package - contains class/classes/interface/interfaces/file/files/folder/folders

* Project - consist of package/packages/file/files/folder/folders/source(src)folder

* static - static means belongs to the class. If govt hospital is class, then hospital receptionist is a static member of that class. 
We can not seperate them variables and methods can be static
			within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
			Outside calss - static can be used but alone with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)

* Object (instatiation or initiation)  - E.g: Medical camp; 
			We create Object only for classes; Whenever we create object we copy whatever the class contains(except static)
			means, only non-static is copied
			Through object we can not call static things.

* Constructor - Object creation happens with the help of constructor
				constructor is available in different kind
				1. without any money/permission
				2. only with money
				3. only with permission
				4. with both money and permission
				
				
*******************************************************************
DAY 3(03/05/2023)

Class - important thing, through which we perform some task. Class may contains methods and variables

Method1 - A work
Method2 - B work
Method3 - C work ( A work + some other work)

redundant - repeatable 
reuse

Variables - shape and count/name
shape - datatype 

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Datatype: Its a classification of a data, which tells the compiler or interpretor about how the programmer intends to use the data.

1) Primitive
	a) boolean - yes or no OR true or false 
	b) Textual 
		char - a, b, c, A, B
		byte - 
			byte x = 10;
	c) numeric 
		int 
		short
		double
		long
		float

2) Non Primitive
	d) String 
	e) array

each datatype has a default value

* default value of String is null
* default value of int is 0
* boolean - false

How we declare datatypes
Syntax = accessModifier dataType variableName/variable = variableValue

int a = 10;  
int a;
String a = "10";
String a;
String a = null; (null is a keyword here, it means String a has nothing.)
String a = "null"; ("null" is a String/word here.)
double a = 10d;
char sathya = 'A';
boolean Boolean = true;

int a; - declare
a = 10; - define/initiate

int a = 10;
int - data type( primitive --> numeric)
a - variable/variableName;
10 - value posses by the variable/ value pointed by the variable


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


Variables - Its a memory location that can hold values of a specific datatype.

Types of variables 
1. Local variable - 
	* Datatype declared/initiated within a method/constructor, for, if    -- block ({...})
	* scope of local variable is only within the block in which the variable is declared
	* intialisation of local variable is madatory
	* local variables can not be static
	{
	int a = 10;
	char c;
	c = 20;
	String sathya = "10";
	}
	
2. Instance variable/class variable/non-static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block ({...})
	* Non- static variables
	* To access instance variables, we need to create object
	
	int a = 10;
	String sathya = "10";
	
	
3. static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block
	* static keyword is used with variables and methods
	* To access this variable, dont need to create an object
	* within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
	* Outside class - static can be used but along with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)
	
	static int a = 10;
	static String sathya = "10";
	
	ClassA (TalukOffice) {

static int a = 10;
//a = receptionist;

method1() {

print (a);


}

}


ClassB (Govt hospital) {

method2() {
print (ClassA.a);
//print (TalukOffice.receptionist)
}
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
	
Access Modifier
	* It defines where and who can use a method/variable/class
	1) default
	2) private
	3) protected
	4) public 
	
	Syntax = accessModifier dataType variableName/variable = variableValue
	int a = 10; - default (no need to mention "default" word
	private int a = 10;
	protected int a = 10;
	public int a = 10;
	
	
	packageA
		classA ( public int a = 10)
			ClassAA (same package and sub class of A)
		classB (same package but non sub class of A)
	packageX
		classX (diff package non sub class)
		classXA (diff package but sub class of A)
		
	

                                     | default |  private  | protected  | public 
									 |         |           |            |

JVM, JRE, JDK

our codes - english - .java
compile - .class - byte code (machine recognizable language)


JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
* This can not be seen
* it starts the execution(creates Runtime Environment)
* It first checks for main method
* It creates the code flow, in java the flow is called "Thread" 
* JVM provides run time environment in which Java byte codes can be executed
* loads code| verifies code| execute code| provides run time environment

JRE - Java Runtime Environment
* Physically exist
* Contains JVM and set of libraries
* JVM uses these libraries to execute the codes

JDK - Java Developement kit
* It contains JVM, set of libraries and dev tools (JRE + dev tools)
* Used to develop and execute the codes
* Dev tools + debugger + compiler + java doc

What is eclipse (IDE)

Its an editor to edit and view your project or project files
While writing itself, it will notify us about complilation errors

Its a user interface to view your project or file in an easy way

* Dependency Management tool
* we dont need to download any jar files(dependency).
* Group ID, Artifact ID and Version
* If we create a project with mavan as a dependency management tool, we get a proper project structure.
* Important file in maven project is pom.xml. In this file, we add dependency details 
* Dependencies will be stored in .m2 folder

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Git (one of the SCM - source code management tools)

We can store our project code in a proper structure. 
It will help us to reduce time and many people can work on a project at a same time 

1. Create a project in local (our system)
2. Create git account
3. Create a repo in your git account (remote)
4. We view our local project in system through Eclipse
5. We need to connect our Eclipse with Git repo

upload project in Git

Steps to upload project in Git hub

1) Create a remote repository
2) In your system open git bash from your project location
3) enter below commands
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "any message you can type here"
	git remote add origin SSHURL
	git push origin master
	
	
	To view status:  git status 
	to clear lines: clear
